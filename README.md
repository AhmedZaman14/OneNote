# OneNote

Plz first go through the ProjectReport.pdf file.

This is my first project so plz do not expect extra ordinary, but yeah i will try my best of creating a similar app like Microsoft's OneNote Android version. 
Sql server will be used on the backend.
From design to the final outcome i will be on my own, i guess.
I hope Students of Software and Computer Science can learn something from this, as i am also in the 4th semester of Software Engineering and this project is of my semester course DBMS. 


# How to run this project on your PC.
First restore the sql server database that i have given.
You probably only have to change the Connection String in the code.
Where ever is SqlConnnection plz change its String.
I am assuming that you know how to change SqlCon String.

# About Code.
    The code may be very rough, but hey it works. I added comments also.
Remember this is my 4th semester's project so my concern was to just get it done.

# Not Priorities: 
       Design (UI).
       Clean Code.
          
          
# Constraints
        1. Every User have fixed Sections (3).
        2. Each section can have 10 pages each. So 1 user can have total of 30 max Page which is okay i guess because you can also delete notes and then recreate so its understandable.
